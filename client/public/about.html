      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Formed in September 2018, just for the purpose of this CodeClan JavaScript project, RASR is made up of 4 team members:
      <br>  Ricky, Anne, Shannon, and Robert. <br>
      The BBC Educational App entitled Landmarks is the first app they have worked collaboratively on.  <br>It currently only contains man-made landmarks 🗿 🏛️ ⛩️ 🕌 🗽, and even it is not an exhaustive list of landmarks.
